# ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ Visualising Psychological Data in Python: A Tutorial ðŸ“‰ðŸ“Š

This repository hosts a notebook introduction to producing **publication-quality figures** for psychological data in Python, with no installations required. There are many resources for learning how to plot data in Python, but to my knowledge no specific tutorial for psychologists, especially undergraduate students who might be interested in getting some experience with coding. This notebook is intended to be highly accessible, with this audience in mind, but anyone interested in visualising psychological data in Python can learn from it. ***No previous coding experience is assumed or needed*** to follow the tutorial, and you can create your own figures by tweaking the code given.

The notebook walks you through all the basic steps to producing visualisations, from loading Excel files to exporting your figure. We cover many graphs commonly seen in psychological research, including histograms, density plots, scatterplots, bar plots, line plots, and violin plots. When considering scatterplots, we also look at how to make multipanel figures, i.e. figures with multiple embedded plots or subplots. In addition, because certain plots rely on specific experimental designs, under the bar plot section we look at how to code your own factorial design, with as many variables and levels as needed.

To make the tutorial more engaging, some interactive visualisations are included, and many plots are demonstrated with data from recently published studies in the behavioural sciences.
